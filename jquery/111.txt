What is jQuery?
jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.
The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

Add New HTML Content

append() - Inserts content at the end of the selected elements
prepend() - Inserts content at the beginning of the selected elements
after() - Inserts content after the selected elements
before() - Inserts content before the selected elements

jQuery append() Method
The jQuery append() method inserts content AT THE END of the selected HTML elements.

jQuery hide() and show()
With jQuery, you can hide and show HTML elements with the hide() and show() methods:

$("#hide").click(function(){
  $("p").hide();
});

$("#show").click(function(){
  $("p").show();
});

jQuery toggle()
You can also toggle between hiding and showing an element with the toggle() method.

Shown elements are hidden and hidden elements are shown:

Example
$("button").click(function(){
  $("p").toggle();
});
