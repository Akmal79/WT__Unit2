What is AJAX?
AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
AJAX is not a programming language.

AJAX just uses a combination of:
A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)
AJAX is a misleading name. AJAX applications might use XML to transport data, but it is equally common to transport data as plain text or JSON text.

AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
The design goals of XML focus on simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages.
Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services.
XML stands for extensible Markup Language
XML is a markup language like HTML
XML is designed to store and transport data
XML is designed to be self-descriptive

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a format for structuring data. This format is used by different web applications to communicate with each other.
It is the replacement of the XML data exchange format. It is easy to struct the data compare to XML. 
It supports data structures like arrays and objects and the JSON documents that are rapidly executed on the server.
