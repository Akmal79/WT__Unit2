What is HTML Canvas?
The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.
The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.
Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.
Canvas is supported by all major browsers.

HTML Video
The HTML <video> element is used to show a video on a web page.

How it Works
The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.
It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.
The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.
The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <video> element.
